🧪 Stroke Prediction with Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting the likelihood of a stroke based on patient data. It includes a Jupyter Notebook with detailed implementation and a healthcare dataset. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training using various machine learning techniques.

🔍 Overview

Strokes are among the leading causes of death globally. Early prediction of stroke can help in timely medical interventions and potentially save lives. This project explores how machine learning can assist in predicting the likelihood of strokes using patient data.

📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from a healthcare dataset for stroke prediction. It contains patient information such as age, gender, medical history, and more. The dataset file is named healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv and includes the following columns:

id: Unique identifier for each patient

gender: Gender of the patient (Male, Female, Other)

age: Age of the patient

hypertension: 0 if the patient does not have hypertension, 1 if they do

heart_disease: 0 if the patient does not have any heart diseases, 1 if they do

ever_married: Yes or No

work_type: Type of occupation

Residence_type: Urban or Rural

avg_glucose_level: Average glucose level in blood

bmi: Body Mass Index

smoking_status: Smoking habits (formerly smoked, never smoked, smokes, Unknown)

stroke: 1 if the patient had a stroke, 0 otherwise (Target variable)

🔄 Project Workflow

1. ⚖️ Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values.

Encode categorical variables.

Normalize numerical features.

2. 🔬 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize data distributions.

Explore relationships between features and the target variable.

3. 🤖 Model Building
